# A repository for tracking my learning of Vulkan

## Fist resource
My learning started with [this](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/)

As the tutorial website says this tutorial teaches the basics of Vukan, as such it was a good place to start.
While the tutorial uses C++17, it dessn't really use any modern C++ techniques.

The results of this are in the `tutorial_website` folder

Status: Completed

## Second resource
Afterwards I continiued learning from [this](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8327DO66nu9qYVKLDmdLW_84-yE4auCR) youtube series.

It was chosen as ot goes into more advanced topics and actually uses modern C++ features. Althou it still uses the C vulkan API instead of the C++ one, it wraps the up into modern C++ compliant objects.

The results of this are in the `tutorial_series` folder

Status: In Progress
